This game was created on Unity by a team of 6 undergraduates.

How it works:
The main objective of the game is to accept or deny people into "Dance Klub". However, be careful as some of the club goers waiting outside may be zombies. Make sure to look at the symptoms of the club goers and reject the zombies, or else it will shorten down the time! Have fun!
